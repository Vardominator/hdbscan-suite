# HDBSCAN Suite

## TODOs
* Implement logging
* Run on Xavier's machine with entire stable luteo dataset
* Run with min samples = 100 to 1500 in steps of 100
* Run with setting min samples = 1 and varying cluster size from 100 to 1500 in steps of 100
* Write install and usage instructions in README

## RANDOM NOTES
* 
* min_cluster_size must be greater than 1
